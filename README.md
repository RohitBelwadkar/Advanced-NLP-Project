# Advanced NLP Projects with TensorFlow 2.0
This is the code repository for [Advanced NLP Projects with TensorFlow 2.0 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/advanced-nlp-projects-tensorflow-20-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the field of Artificial Intelligence that deals with text analysis and understanding. Some of the fields in which NLP is widely used are sentiment classification, spam detection and topic detection. Deep Learning is one of the tools that helps us solving NLP problems.
This course will get you started with real world NLP projects and you will learn how to get the best from text data. We will be building and training models in real-world projects and focus on interactions between computers and humans with Tensorflow 2.0. Together we will dive deep in a collection of text, writing a jupyter notebook step by step until we obtain actionable insights and powerful visualizations. 
By the end of the course, you will be able to build and implement your own NLP techniques and projects effectively with much ease confidently.
